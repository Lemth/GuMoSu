//First, we need to enable views and make our view visible (in this case, view 0)
view_enabled = true;//Enable the use of views
view_set_visible(0, true);//Make this view visible

//First, create the camera. We could use camera_create_view, but that is more useful in a 2D environment
camera = camera_create();

//Then, we need to build a projection matrix. I keep this in instance scope in case I need to reassign it later. (Though you can retrieve matrices from a camera with camera_get functions
//I use matrix_build_projection_perspective_fov, as it gives the most control over how your projections looks.
//Here's how I use the arguments: I give a 60 degree vertical field of view, with a ratio of view_wport/view_hport, with a 32 unit near clipping plane, and a 32000 far clipping plane. Some of these values may need tweaking to your liking.
projMat = matrix_build_projection_perspective_fov(60, view_get_wport(0)/view_get_hport(0), 32, 32000);

//Now we assign the projection matrix to the camera
camera_set_proj_mat(camera, projMat);

//Finally, we bind the camera to the view
view_set_camera(0, camera);

//Assigns the update script named "camera_update_script" to the camera belonging to view0
camera_set_update_script(view_camera[0], camera_update_script);
